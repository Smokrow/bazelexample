    "0. Get familar with the current Bazel repository by opening the MODULE.bazel and the BUILD file. Check out what is in there.\n",

    "1. Open up the 02_library_and_test folder in your terminal\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Install bazelisk by running `npm install -g @bazel/bazelisk` if not done already\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Query all target in this project by running `bazelisk query ...`. The 3 dots in this case mean \"everything\"\n",

    "4. Query the dependency of the //:main by running `bazelisk query --noimplicit_deps  \"deps(//:main)\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Open the BUILD File in the librarys Folder \n",
    "\n",
    "6. There are 2 .py files that are not added to the build system yet. Add another py_library target to the BUILD File for converter.py called converter. Watch out for any dependencies this code has and it add to the dependencies. \n",

    "## Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Add a py_test target for converter_test.py. Call it converter_test and add the dependencies this code need. \n",
    "\n",
    "8. Run the test by running `bazelisk run //library:converter_test`\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Test is directly by running `bazelisk test //library:converter_test` and notice the difference compared to the run target.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Test all test targets in your bazel project by running `bazelisk test //...` "
